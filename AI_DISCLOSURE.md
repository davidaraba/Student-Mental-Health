## AI Assistance Disclosure

This project was completed with the assistance of artificial intelligence tools. The following sections detail the specific ways AI was utilized throughout the development and analysis process.

### 1. Code Review and Grammar Enhancement

**AI Tool Used:** Claude (Anthropic) via Cursor IDE

**Purpose:** The AI was used to review the entire Jupyter notebook for grammatical errors, sentence structure, and overall flow. This included:

- Replacing possessive nouns and personal pronouns with more professional, academic language
- Improving sentence structure and readability
- Ensuring consistent tone throughout the document
- Correcting grammatical errors and awkward phrasing

**Impact:** The AI assistance significantly improved the professional presentation of the notebook while maintaining the technical accuracy and original content.

### 2. Conceptual Understanding and Learning

**AI Tool Used:** Claude (Anthropic) via Cursor IDE

**Purpose:** AI was used to enhance understanding of complex machine learning concepts, including:

- **Elbow Method for Clustering:** Understanding the mathematical principles behind the Within Set Sum of Squared Errors (WSSSE) and how to interpret the "elbow" point in the curve
- **Machine Learning Methodologies:** Deepening comprehension of:
  - Logistic Regression coefficients and their interpretation
  - KMeans clustering algorithm and silhouette scoring
  - Association Rule Mining with FPGrowth algorithm
  - Feature importance analysis techniques
- **Statistical Concepts:** Understanding metrics like AUC-ROC, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, and R-squared

**Impact:** This AI assistance helped ensure accurate implementation and interpretation of advanced machine learning techniques.

### 3. Result Interpretation and Analysis

**AI Tool Used:** Claude (Anthropic) via Cursor IDE

**Purpose:** AI was consulted to help interpret complex results and provide insights, including:

- Analyzing confusion matrices and performance metrics
- Understanding the significance of feature importance rankings
- Interpreting association rules and their practical implications
- Explaining clustering results and student profile identification
- Understanding why certain models performed poorly (e.g., low R² in regression)

**Impact:** AI assistance enabled more sophisticated analysis and clearer explanation of results, leading to deeper insights about student mental health patterns.

### 4. Documentation and Formatting

**AI Tool Used:** Claude (Anthropic) via Cursor IDE

**Purpose:** AI was used to improve the overall presentation and documentation quality:

- Formatting markdown cells for better readability
- Structuring explanations in a logical, academic manner
- Creating professional visualizations descriptions
- Ensuring consistent formatting throughout the notebook
- Improving the flow between sections

**Impact:** The AI assistance resulted in a more polished, professional document that effectively communicates the research findings.

### 5. Technical Implementation Guidance

**AI Tool Used:** Claude (Anthropic) via Cursor IDE

**Purpose:** AI provided guidance on technical implementation aspects:

- Understanding Spark MLlib pipeline construction
- Proper data preprocessing techniques
- Feature engineering best practices
- Model evaluation methodologies
- Visualization techniques for big data analytics

**Impact:** This guidance ensured the implementation followed best practices and utilized Spark's capabilities effectively.

## Academic Integrity Statement

While AI tools were used extensively in this project, all code implementation, data analysis, and research conclusions remain the original work of the student. The AI assistance was used as a learning and enhancement tool, similar to consulting textbooks, online resources, or academic advisors. The core research, data interpretation, and project insights are the student's own work.

## Learning Outcomes

The use of AI in this project enhanced the learning experience by:

1. **Accelerating Understanding:** AI helped quickly grasp complex machine learning concepts that would have taken significantly longer to understand through traditional methods alone.

2. **Improving Quality:** AI assistance resulted in higher quality documentation and more professional presentation of results.

3. **Deepening Analysis:** AI helped identify patterns and insights in the data that might have been overlooked, leading to more comprehensive analysis.

4. **Best Practices:** AI guidance ensured the implementation followed industry best practices for big data analytics and machine learning.

## Conclusion

This AI disclosure demonstrates transparency in the use of artificial intelligence tools throughout the project development process. The AI assistance was used ethically as a learning and enhancement tool, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive and professionally presented analysis of student mental health data using Apache Spark.
