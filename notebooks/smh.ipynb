    "## 1. Introduction & Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Objective\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to develop and evaluate a suite of machine learning models using Apache Spark to predict the likelihood of depression among students. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset that includes demographic, academic, and lifestyle factors, I aim to identify key indicators associated with mental health challenges in an academic environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Significance\n",
    "Student mental health is a growing concern globally. The pressures of academic life, combined with financial and social stressors, can significantly impact a student's well-being and academic performance. This project is important because it seeks to create a data-driven framework that could potentially identify at-risk students, enabling educational institutions to offer timely and targeted support. By using scalable cloud computing technologies, we can build a foundation for a system capable of handling large-scale, real-world student data, moving from reactive to proactive mental wellness strategies. This aligns with the need for modern solutions that traditional computing can struggle to scale effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Technical Stack\n",
    "This project will be implemented using the following technologies:\n",
    "* **Language:** Python 3.x\n",
    "* **Core Engine:** Apache Spark (via PySpark)\n",
    "* **Libraries:**\n",
    "    * **Spark MLlib:** For building scalable machine learning pipelines.\n",
    "    * **Pandas:** For initial data handling and manipulation.\n",
    "    * **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualisation and result interpretation."

    "## 2. Project Architecture & Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Workflow Description\n",
    "This project follows a standard big data analytics workflow, as depicted in the diagram below. The process begins with the ingestion of four separate but related data files into the Spark environment. These datasets are then joined and pre-processed to create a unified, analysis-ready master dataset. Subsequently, this dataset is used to train and evaluate four distinct machine learning functionalities as required by the project specification: classification, regression, clustering, and association rule mining. The final insights and model performance metrics are then visualised to provide clear, interpretable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Architecture Diagram\n",
    "This diagram illustrates the project's workflow from data source to final analysis. It explicitly shows the use of multiple data sources and the application of various Spark MLlib functionalities, fulfilling the key project requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Architecture Explanation\n",
    "The above workflow diagram demonstrates a comprehensive big data analytics pipeline designed for scalable student mental health analysis. The process begins with four distinct data sources being ingested simultaneously into the Spark environment, leveraging Spark's distributed processing capabilities to handle large-scale datasets efficiently. The unified master dataset is then processed through feature engineering pipelines before being split for model training and evaluation. The four ML functionalities operate in parallel, each addressing different aspects of student mental health prediction and analysis. This architecture showcases the power of cloud computing technologies in handling complex, multi-dimensional data analysis tasks that would be challenging with traditional single-machine approaches.\n"

    "### Interpreting the Student Cluster Profiles \n",
    "\n",
    "This table is the key to understanding our four student clusters. By comparing the average values, we can see two distinct types of student profiles emerge: an **\"At-Risk\"** group and a **\"More Resilient\"** group.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clusters 1 & 3: The At-Risk Group**\n",
    "    * **High Depression Rate:** These two groups have a very high prevalence of depression, at **~69%**.\n",
    "    * **High Stressors:** This high depression rate is strongly correlated with higher average **Academic Pressure (~3.24)** and **Financial Stress (~3.28)**.\n",
    "    * **Profile:** These clusters represent students who are under significant academic and financial strain, which appears to be a major factor in their mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clusters 0 & 2: The More Resilient Group**\n",
    "    * **Lower Depression Rate:** These groups have a significantly lower (though still notable) prevalence of depression, ranging from **42% to 49%**.\n",
    "    * **Lower Stressors:** This corresponds with lower average **Academic Pressure (~3.0)** and **Financial Stress (~2.9)**.\n",
    "    * **Profile:** These clusters represent students who experience less external pressure, which correlates with better mental health outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, the **Average CGPA** is almost identical across all four clusters, suggesting that academic performance itself is not the defining characteristic of these groups. Instead, the key differentiators are the **perceived levels of stress**. This is a powerful insight, as it validates our clustering model and identifies clear, actionable factors that correlate with student depression."

    "\n",
    "Our fourth and final analytical task is **Association Rule Mining**, another form of unsupervised learning. The goal here is to discover hidden \"if-then\" rules or relationships within our dataset. For example, we might find a rule like `{Low Sleep, High Financial Stress} => {Depressed}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the **FPGrowth** algorithm in Spark MLlib. This algorithm requires the data to be in a specific format: each row must have a single column containing a list (or \"basket\") of categorical \"items\". To achieve this, our workflow will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Discretize Numerical Data:** We must convert our continuous numerical features (like `CGPA` and `Academic Pressure`) into discrete categories (like 'Low_CGPA', 'High_Pressure'). We'll use the `QuantileDiscretizer` to automatically create meaningful bins (e.g., Low, Medium, High).\n",
    "2.  **Combine All Features:** We will then combine these new discretized features with our original categorical features into a single \"items\" list for each student.\n",
    "3.  **Train FPGrowth:** We'll run the FPGrowth model on this prepared data to generate the rules.\n",
    "4.  **Interpret the Rules:** We will analyze the generated rules based on three key metrics:\n",
    "    * **Antecedent (if):** The item or set of items on the left side of the rule.\n",
    "    * **Consequent (then):** The item on the right side of the rule.\n",
    "    * **Confidence:** The probability that the consequent occurs, given the antecedent. A confidence of 0.8 means the rule is correct 80% of the time.\n",
    "    * **Lift:** How much more likely the consequent is to occur when the antecedent is present. A lift greater than 1 indicates a meaningful relationship."

    "#### Understanding the X-Axis (Importance)\n",
    "The x-axis, **\"Coefficient Magnitude,\"** represents the \"voting power\" of each feature in the model's decision. A longer bar means the feature has a stronger influence; for example, the model pays far more attention to `City: Nalyan` (with a score over 50) than it does to `Profession: Digital Marketer` (with a score below 30).\n",

    "#### The Dominance of Location 🗺️\n",
    "The most striking finding is that **specific cities are by far the most powerful predictors of depression**. Features like `City: Nalyan` and `City: Bhavna` have the highest importance scores. This suggests that there are strong underlying geographical or socio-economic factors associated with these specific cities that are heavily correlated with student mental health in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Role of Profession 🧑‍🏫\n",
    "After location, a few specific professions also show some predictive power.

    "* **Scalability:** All data loading, pre-processing, and model training tasks were performed efficiently. This architecture could seamlessly scale to handle a dataset with millions of student records without requiring significant code changes.\n",
    "* **Unified Framework:** Spark provided a single, unified API to handle everything from initial data ingestion (Spark SQL) to complex machine learning (Spark MLlib). This streamlined the entire workflow and is a significant advantage over traditional tools that would require separate libraries for each step.\n",

    "### 5.3 Future Work \n",
    "\n",
    "While this project was successful, there are several exciting avenues for future work:\n",
    "* **Model Deployment:** The trained Logistic Regression model could be deployed as a real-time web application or API. This could serve as the backend for a student wellness tool that provides early-intervention recommendations.\n",
    "* **Advanced Algorithms:** More complex models, such as Gradient-Boosted Trees or Random Forests, could be trained to potentially improve predictive accuracy and capture non-linear relationships in the data.\n",
    "* **Deeper Feature Engineering:** Incorporating additional data sources, such as social media activity or university attendance records, could provide new features that might improve the predictability of both depression and academic performance."
